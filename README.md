# COMP371-HW2
Notes: <br>
None of the extra credit features were done <br>
But I did implement the date inclusiveness <br>
If a user inputs a date, results will return beers also brewed on the input date(s) too <br>
Ex. Buzz is first brewed on 09/2007, so a start date and/or end date having the input(s) "09/2007" will still display the Buzz Brew <br>
Also, validation of the date range i.e Start date must be earlier than end date is still checked with the inclusiveness is still checked - its done by checking the PRE-inlcusivness of the date ranges <br>
Also, spaces in names a user inputs are also valid inputs, as they are replaced with underscores per the API doc
